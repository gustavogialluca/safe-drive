# MPU6050
All the inertial sensor code was implemented reading data from a ESP32 microcontroller for testing purposes. The integration with all the functionalities can be found in the integration directory

# Machine Learning
In the AI directory, you can find some examples of the inertial data processing for inference using the public Mendeley Dataset (posted on https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jj3tw8kj6h/2). Two applications were made in the train file: SVC and Logistic Regression.
